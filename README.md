## About the Game
The LC-3 Guessing Game is a simple guessing game created in assembly language. Take a peek at the flowchart to understand the logic behind the game. If you're curious, explore the assembly code to delve into the intricacies of the LC-3 architecture.

## How to Run
To run the game on an LC-3 simulator, follow these steps:
1. Load the provided runnable file into the LC-3 simulator (the runnable file is GuessingGame.obj)
2. Execute the program to start the game.

Remember that the game only allows number guesses betweeen 0-9. Any other guess will be invalid and print out a error message. You have only 9 guesses to get the right number, once all guesses are used, the program shows, "Game Over". If the user guesses correctly, in 9 guesses or less, then they get a congratulations message. Invalid inputs (anything other than numbers between 0-9) count as guesses. 

#Additional Information
The file titled "GuessingGame" is the one that contains the assembly language. If you press on it, you can see the source code itself
The obj file is the one you use in LC3 to run the guessing game itself

Feel free to explore the code and try out different inputs
