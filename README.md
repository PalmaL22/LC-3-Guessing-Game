## About the Game
The LC-3 Guessing Game is a simple guessing game created in assembly language. Take a peek at the flowchart to understand the logic behind the game. If you're curious, explore the assembly code to delve into the intricacies of the LC-3 architecture.

## How to Run
To run the game on an LC-3 simulator, follow these steps:
1. Load the provided runnable file into the LC-3 simulator.
2. Execute the program to start the game.

Remember that the game only allows number guesses betweeen 0-9. Any other guess will be invalid and print out a message. You have only 9 guesses to get the right number, once all guesses are used, the program shows, "Game Over". If the user guesses correctly, in 9 guesses or less, then they get a congratulations message. Invalid guessses (anything other than numbers between 0-9) count as guesses.
